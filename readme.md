=======================

This is a binary patching tool that will aid in making WoW 5.4.8 playable on
unofficial servers, by patching out the server redirection (which involves
the RSA algorithm).

To run it: 
+ 1 - Compile source in release with Visual Studio C# 2013 or download from the _Extras folder.
+ 2 - Drag Wow.exe and Wow-64.exe over the patcher .exe icon, when prompted press enter.
+ 3 - You should now have Wow-patched.exe and Wow-64-Patched.exe in the WoW folder, these are your patched WoW files.

Based on SkyFire patcher code

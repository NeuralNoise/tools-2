This is a binary patching tool that will aid in making WoW 5.4.8 playable on
unofficial servers, by patching out the server redirection (which involves
the RSA algorithm).

To run it: 
+ 1 - Compile source in release with Visual Studio C# 2013
+ 2 - Drag your wow.exe and wow-64.exe to the patcher icon to patch.

Based on SkyFire patcher code
